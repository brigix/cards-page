					"text": "In this card, we encounter the contradiction between confidence and intellect, be- tween faith and reason. And the guilt one feels when one leaves the path of faith and opts for the path of reason. Both are so difficult to reconcile. How can I prove that God exists? How can I believe in Him when I am so full of doubt? This card says: Both exist, doubt as well as faith, science and mysticism, physics and metaphysics. Whoever tries to unify the one with the other is making a mistake. They are both equally valid mental potentials and can stand well beside each other with neither be- ing accused or blamed for anything."
